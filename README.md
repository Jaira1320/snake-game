python snake game
A Python-based Snake Game is a simple arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food to grow while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen boundaries.

Basic Features:
The snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, right) using keyboard controls.
Food appears randomly on the screen, and the snake grows when it eats the food.
The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.
A score counter keeps track of the player's progress.
Technology & Libraries Used:
Python as the programming language.
Pygame library for handling graphics and game logic.
Random module to generate food at random positions.
